Goal of this test:


- Write two classes with a different package in file, but with no specific folder structure
- Write a script that can resolve the location of the two classes compiled classfile:
    - using SCLASSPATH environment variable
    - If the class has not been compiled, compile it:
        - Detect if it is a simple file, if it is a maven project etc...

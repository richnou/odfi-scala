This module provides an up to date installation of Scala, as well as utility scripts

== Calling scala ==

Once setup, the module adds a standard scala installation to the path.
scalac, scala etc... should be accessible normally

== Scripting Scala ==

The ''scala'' startup script provides basic support for executing a file containing scala.
It lacks however a very few features which are provided by the ''scala_script'' improvement.

=== Writing a simple script ===

To write a simple scala script, simply open a file, and use this template:


<code class="scala">#!/usr/bin/env scala_script
println("This is scala here")
</code>

=== Augmenting the classpath ===

The main problem with scripting scala, is that the script starts with the default Java + Scala classpath.
If you need some additional libraries, you could improve the classpath at runtime, but the additonal classes referenced in the script
would prevent it from compiling.
That is why, your classpath must be complete when starting the script.

To palliate this issue, a scala script may contain an embedded bootstrap script, which will be extracted an run prior to the main script.
The output of this script will be parsed for lines containing references to jar or folder files, each of which will be added to the main classpath

==== Embedded Bootstrap Script ====

This template provides an embedded bootstrap script


<code class="scala">
  #!/usr/bin/env scala_script

  __SCALA_CLASSPATH__


  HERE COMES THE BOOTSTRAP SCRIPT

  __EOF_SCALA_CLASSPATH__
  
  import my.user.library.MyClass

  println("This is scala here")
</code>
